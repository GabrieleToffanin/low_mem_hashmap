# low_mem_hashmap

An HashMap implementation in Rust that doesn't occupy a lot of memory. This is not very fast but i'll work on this for sure when i'll be gaining more knowledge !

I am going to try implementing linear or quadratic probing for collision handling, and a rehash function for when the hash_table load factor is near 0.75.

Probably some Rust experts will find this code terrible, so if you want to suggest improvements am happy to learn !
